# Food-Order-App

The Food Order App is a React application that allows users to conveniently order food online. Users can select their desired items from the available menu, add them to their cart, and proceed to confirm the order. The cart displays essential information, such as the total amount to be paid, the number of meals for each type, and the price of each type of meal. Once the user confirms the order, a form with simple validation prompts the user to enter their details. After confirmation, the order data is sent to the backend on Firebase, and a confirmation message is displayed to the user. All meal data is securely saved on the Firebase backend.
